# neural network implementation

Iron man is one of my favorite movies ever. One of the reasons I like this movie so much is the super intelligent AI assistant, J.A.R.V.I.S. I've always wanted to create my own, and as such, I set out to learn how I can make this happen.

This repository is the software implementation of the neural network as described in https://oscarfal.hashnode.dev/.

This project is currently unfinished.
